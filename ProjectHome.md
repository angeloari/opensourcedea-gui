## OSDEA GUI - The Open Source Data Envelopment Analysis Program ##

Data Envelopment Analysis is a state of the art benchmarking technique which can potentially help people doing better multi-criteria performance measurement studies. There exist DEA software programs although these are generally either not really comprehensive or really expensive.

This project aims at providing a free and open source program to solve Data Envelopment Analysis problems with no restrictions on the number of variables or units. If you are looking for a library rather than a GUI, check the [opensourcedea page](http://code.google.com/p/opensourcedea/).

**You can find Installation Instructions for OSDEA GUI on:
